# Board Games in 3D!

This is a board game engine created in Three.js and Rust, designed to make it as easy as possible to start playing a boardgame online.

[Try it now!](https://birdga.me/), also check out the [itch.io page](https://tesseractcat.itch.io/birdgame).

## Building

Building is simple. You will need a recent version of Rust + NPM.

First, install the npm packages with `npm install`. Next, run `build.sh`. You're done!
(Right now I'm patching Three.js to only export `/src/Three.js`, for better tree-shaking).

## Usage

All lobbies are given a unique URL: `https://example.com/lobby_name`. You can
give a lobby a custom name, or get a random one generated by visiting the base URL.

**Controls:**
- <kbd>Left click</kbd> and drag to orbit
- <kbd>Shift click</kbd> and drag to pan
- <kbd>Scroll wheel</kbd> to zoom
- <kbd>Click and drag</kbd> to move objects
- <kbd>T</kbd> to take an object or card from a bag or deck
- <kbd>G</kbd> to add a card to your hand
- And of course <kbd>Right click</kbd> any object for more!

## Making games

Creating a new game is easy. Just zip up your assets with a `manifest.json` with a `main.lua` script.
Then just drag your zip file onto the game window.

You can register up to 40MiB of assets (each under 2 MiB), which will be stored and distributed on the server
until the lobby closes.

There isn't any documentation yet, but take a look at `plugins/*/` for guidance.

For models:
- Add colliders to GLTF files by adding a custom `collider` property set to either `box` or `cylinder`.
- Units are in inches.
