## Building

Building is simple. You will need a recent version of Rust + NPM.

First, install the npm packages with `npm install`. Next, run `build.sh`. You're done!

## Usage

All lobbies are given a unique URL: `https://example.com/lobby_name`. You can
give a lobby a custom name, or get a random one generated by visiting the base URL.

Controls:
- <kbd>Left click</kbd> and drag to orbit
- <kbd>Right click</kbd> or <kbd>shift click</kbd> and drag to pan
- <kbd>Scroll wheel</kbd> to zoom
- <kbd>Click and drag</kbd> to pick up/put down objects
- <kbd>G</kbd> to add a card to your hand
- <kbd>T</kbd> to take an object or card from a bag or deck
- And of course <kbd>right click</kbd> any object for more!

## Adding new games

Creating a new game is easy. Just zip up your assets with a `manifest.json` along with a script like `game.js`.

There isn't any documentation yet, but take a look at `static/prelude.js` and `static/games/*.js` for guidance.
